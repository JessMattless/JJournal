# JJournal
*JJournal is a mood journal, but more!* it is also an application usage tracker. These concepts have been combined into one mobile app to help you take charge of your mental health.

This application will allow you to add journal entries, giving you the option to speak your mind whenever you want... The application then uses your app usage data, mainly the hours you use each app to gather data on what applications you use in what moods.

The application will show you what applications you tend to use more when you are feeling certain moods, which can help you to limit your application usage!

Say, for example. You think you use social media much more when you're in a bad mood? This application will tell you for sure, and you can use that information to help limit yourself if you think that usage is hindering your mood further.
